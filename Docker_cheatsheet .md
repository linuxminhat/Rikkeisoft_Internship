## Key Concepts

### **Docker**
Docker provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment called a container. Containers are lightweight and include everything needed to run the application, ensuring it runs consistently across environments. You can easily share containers to ensure uniform functionality.

---

### **Images**
Docker images are lightweight, standalone, executable packages of software that include everything required to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, and settings.

---

### **Docker Hub**
Docker Hub is a service provided by Docker for finding and sharing container images with your team. Learn more and find images at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com).

---

### **Containers**
A container is a runtime instance of a Docker image. It ensures consistent software behavior across environments by isolating software from its environment.
