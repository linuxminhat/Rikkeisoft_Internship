## FILES AND DIRECTORIES PERMISSION (chmod)

There are 3 types of permission:

- `r`



- `-`: Tệp
- `rw`: read and write.

To remove the read permission for the group, use the following command:

```bash
chmod g-r susan

PERMISSION USING NUMERIC MODE (chmod)
Owners assign permission on every file and directory:

User: Read/Write/Execute
Group: Read/Write/Execute
All: Read/Write/Execute
NUMBER | PERMISSION TYPE | SYMBOL
Number	Permission Type	Symbol
0	No Permission	
1	Execute	
2	Write	
3	Execute + Write	
4	Read	
5	Read + Execute	
6	Read + Write	
7	Read + Write + Execute	
Example:
bash
Copy code
chmod 764 FILE
This means:

7 for user (Read + Write + Execute).
6 for group (Read + Write).
4 for others (Read).
