# Working with Images & Containers

---

## The Core Building Blocks

### Images vs Containers

| Docker                 | Images                          | Containers                          |
|------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Images**: Templates/Blueprints for containers | **Containers**: The running "unit of software" based on the image |

---

### Images

- **Definition**: Images are like templates (bản mẫu) or blueprints (bản thiết kế).
- **Static copies**: They are static copies of the application, containing the source code, libraries, tools, and necessary runtimes.
- **Immutable**: Images are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed once built.

---

### Containers

- **Definition**: Containers are the running units of software based on images.
- **Isolation**: When a container is started, Docker creates an isolated working environment based on the image.

## Using & Running External (Pre-built) Images

- **Pre-built images**: These are Docker images that are pre-built by the community or other sources.
- **Source**: Pre-built images are shared on platforms like Docker Hub.

### Steps to use External Images:

1. **Find the image**: Search for the desired image on Docker Hub.
2. **Pull the image**:
    ```bash
    docker pull python:2
    ```
3. **Run the container**:
    ```bash
    docker run -p 3000:3000 python:2
    ```
    Or, interactively:
    ```bash
    docker run -it node
    ```
    - `-i`: Enables input from the terminal.
    - `-t`: Opens an interactive terminal session with the container.

## Finding or Creating Images

1. **Use an existing, pre-built image**: Search and pull images from Docker Hub.
2. **Create a custom image**: Write a custom `Dockerfile` to build your own image.

## CMD vs RUN Commands in Docker

- **RUN**: Executes commands during the image build process.
- **CMD**: Specifies the default command that will run when the container starts.
